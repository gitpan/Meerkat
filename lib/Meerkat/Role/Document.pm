=head1 NAME

Meerkat::Role::Document - Enhances a Moose object with Meerkat methods and metadata

=head1 VERSION

version 0.010

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Your model class:

    package My::Model::Person;

    use Moose;

    with 'Meerkat::Role::Document';

    has name => (
        is       => 'ro',
        isa      => 'Str',
        required => 1,
    );

    has likes => (
        is      => 'ro',
        isa     => 'Num',
        default => 0,
    );

    has tags => (
        is      => 'ro',
        isa     => 'ArrayRef',
        default => sub { [] },
    );

    1;

In your code:

    use Meerkat;

    my $meerkat = Meerkat->new(
        model_namespace => "My::Model",
        database_name => "test"
    );

    my $person = $meerkat->collection("Person"); # My::Model::Person

    # create a document
    my $obj = $person->create( name => "Larry" );

    # change document in the database and update object
    $obj->update_set( name => "Moe" );
    $obj->update_inc( likes => 1 );
    $obj->update_push( tags => qw/cool hot trendy/ );

    # get any other updates from the database
    $obj->sync;

    # delete it
    $obj->remove;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role enhances a Moose class with attributes and methods needed to operate
in tandem with a L<Meerkat::Collection>.

The resulting object is a projection of the document state in the database.
Update methods change the state atomically in the database and synchronize the
object with the new state in the database (potentially including other changes
from other sources).

=head2 Consuming the role

When you apply this role to your Moose class, it provides and manages the
C<_id> attribute for you.  This attribute is meant to be public, but keeps
the leading underscore for consistency with L<MongoDB> classes.

The attributes you define should be read-only.  Modifying attributes directly
in the object will not be reflected in the database and will be lost the next
time you synchronize.

Objects are serialized with L<MooseX::Storage>.  Any attributes that should
not be serialized must have the C<DoNotSerialize> trait:

    has 'expensive' => (
        traits => [ 'DoNotSerialize' ],
        is     => 'lazy',
        isa    => 'HeavyObject',
    );

Attributes with embedded objects are not well supported.  See the
L<Meerkat::Cookbook> for more.

=head2 Working with objects

Create objects from an associated Meerkat::Collection, not with C<new>.

    my $obj = $person->create( %attributes );

That will construct the object, instantiate all lazy attributes (except those
marked C<DoNoSerialize>) and store the new document into the database.

Then, use the various update methods to modify state if you need to.  Use
C<sync> to refresh the object with any remote changes from the database.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

B<Don't call this directly!>  Create objects through the
L<Meerkat::Collection> or they won't be added to the database.

    my $obj = $person->create( name => "Joe" );

=head2 update

    $obj->update( { '$set' => { 'name' => "Moe" } } );

Executes a MongoDB update command on the associated document and updates the
object's attributes.  You must only use MongoDB L<update
operators|http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/nav-update/> to
modify the document's fields.

Returns true if the updates are applied and synchronized.  If the document has
been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as removed;
subsequent C<update>, C<sync> or C<remove> calls will do nothing and return
false.

This command is intended for custom updates with unusual logic or operators.
Many typical updates can be accomplished with the C<update_*> methods described
below.

For all update methods, you can use a MongoDB nested field label to modify
values deep into a data structure. For example C<parents.father> refers to
C<< $obj->parents->{father} >>.

=head2 update_set

    $obj->update_set( name => "Luke Skywalker" );

Sets a field to a value.  This is the MongoDB C<$set> operator.

The field must be undefined or else the existing value and the new value must
be of similar types (e.g. scalar or array or hash).  For the purpose of this
check, an object (e.g. a DateTime) is treated (opaquely) as a scalar value.  If
the types do not match, an error will be thrown.

Note this means that you can't set a defined value to undefined.  To remove a
field entirely, see L</update_clear>.  If you need to make other structural
changes, do it manually with the L</update> method.

Returns true if the update is applied and synchronized.  If the document has
been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as removed.

=head2 update_inc

    $obj->update_inc( likes => 1 );
    $obj->update_inc( likes => -1 );

Increments a field by a positive or negative value.  This is the MongoDB
C<$inc> operator.  The field must be undefined or a numeric scalar value
or an error will be thrown.

Returns true if the update is applied and synchronized.  If the document has
been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as removed.

=head2 update_push

    $obj->update_push( tags => qw/cool hot trendy/ );

Pushes values onto an array reference field. This is the MongoDB C<$push>
operator.  The field must be undefined or an array reference or an error
is thrown.

Returns true if the update is applied and synchronized.  If the document has
been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as removed.

=head2 update_add

    $obj->update_add( tags => qw/cool hot trendy/ );

Pushes values onto an array reference field, but only if they do not already
exist in the array.  This is the MongoDB C<$addToSet> operator.  The field
must be undefined or an array reference or an error is thrown.

Returns true if the update is applied and synchronized.  If the document has
been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as removed.

=head2 update_pop

    $obj->update_pop( 'tags' );

Removes a value from the end of the array.  This is the MongoDB C<$pop>
operator with a direction of "1".    The field must be undefined or an array
reference or an error is thrown.

Returns true if the update is applied and synchronized.  If the document has
been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as removed.

=head2 update_shift

    $obj->update_shift( 'tags' );

Removes a value from the front of the array.  This is the MongoDB C<$pop>
operator with a direction of "-1".   The field must be undefined or an array
reference or an error is thrown.

Returns true if the update is applied and synchronized.  If the document has
been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as removed.

=head2 update_remove

    $obj->update_remove( tags => qw/cool hot/ );

Removes a list of values from the array.  This is the MongoDB C<$pullAll>
operator.   The field must be undefined or an array reference or an error is
thrown.

Returns true if the update is applied and synchronized.  If the document has
been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as removed.

=head2 update_clear

    $obj->update_clear( 'tags' );

Removes a field from a document.  This is the MongoDB C<$unset> operator.
Returns true if the update is applied and synchronized.  If the document has
been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as removed.

Be sure not to clear any required fields.

=head2 sync

    $obj->sync;

Updates object attributes from the database.  Returns true if synced.  If the
document has been removed, the method returns false and the object is marked as
removed; subsequent C<update>, C<sync> or C<remove> calls will do nothing and
return false.

=head2 remove

    $obj->remove;

Removes the associated document from the database.  The object is marked as
removed; subsequent C<update>, C<sync> or C<remove> calls will do nothing and
return false.

=head2 is_removed

    if ( $obj->is_removed ) { ... }

Returns true or false indicating whether the associated document was removed
from the database.

=head2 reinsert

    $obj->reinsert;
    $obj->reinsert( force => 1 );

Reinserts a removed document.  If the C<force> option is true, then it will be
reinserted even if the document has not been removed, overwriting any existing
document in the database.  Returns false if the document is not removed (unless
the force option is true).  Returns true if the document has been reinserted.

=head2 _indexes

    $class->_indexes;

Returns an empty list.  If you want to define indexes for use with the
L<ensure_indexes|Meerkat::Collection/ensure_indexes> method of
L<Meerkat::Collection>, create your own C<_indexes> method that returns a list
of array references.  The array references can have an optional initial hash
reference of indexing options, followed by ordered key & value pairs in the
usual MongoDB way.

You must provide index fields in an array reference because Perl hashes are not
ordered and a compound index requires an order.

For example:

    sub _indexes {
        return (
            [ { unique => 1 }, name => 1 ],
            [ name => 1, zip_code => 1 ]
            [ likes => -1 ],
            [ location => '2dsphere' ],
        );
    }

See the L<Meerkat::Cookbook> for more information.

=head2 _deep_field

    my $value = $obj->_deep_field( "parents.father" ); # hash key
    my $value = $obj->_deep_field( "tags.0" );         # array index

Retrieves a field deep in the object's data structure using MongoDB's dot
